# Intellacc Feature Roadmap

This document provides a detailed roadmap for the development of Intellacc—a social network platform that blends prediction markets with traditional social media features. This roadmap is structured in multiple phases with specific milestones to guide development and iterative improvements.

---

## Phase 1: Core Functionality (Month 1-2)
_This phase establishes the basic building blocks on which the platform will run._

### Authentication & Authorization
- **User Login & Registration**
  - Implement form-based login and registration screens.
  - Validate user inputs and enforce basic security (e.g., password strength).
- **Secure Password Storage**
  - Hash passwords (using bcrypt or similar) on signup.
- **JWT Integration**
  - Issue JSON Web Tokens upon successful login.
  - Set up token verification middleware in the backend.

### User Profiles
- **Basic Profile View**
  - Create user profile pages displaying name, avatar, bio, and prediction summary.
- **Profile Editing**
  - Allow users to update avatar, bio, and social details.
  - Implement basic validation and upload mechanisms for profile images.

### Content Creation
- **Post Creation & Management**
  - Enable users to create status posts with text and image attachments.
  - Support media uploads (storing files on the server or integrated cloud storage).
- **Basic Interactions**
  - Allow users to like or comment on posts.
  - Store interactions in the database with appropriate relationships.

### Basic Prediction Market
- **Prediction Creation**
  - Allow users to create predictions (e.g., binary or odds-based questions).
- **User Participation**
  - Enable users to participate in predictions with a simple yes/no or odds-based vote.
  - Display basic prediction outcomes and visual feedback for participation.

## Phase 2: Enhanced Social Features (Month 3-4)
_This phase focuses on deepening social interactions and refining prediction market mechanics._

### Advanced Profile Management
- **Extended Profile Settings**
  - Add privacy controls (i.e., choose who can view activity, predictions).
  - Implement visibility settings for posts and predictions.
- **Network Features**
  - Introduce a “follow” system for users to subscribe to updates.
  - Build a feed that aggregates content from followed profiles.

### Improved Prediction Market
- **Odds & Confidence Levels**
  - Allow users to set odds and indicate their confidence levels for predictions.
  - Display statistical summaries (e.g., average odds, confidence distribution).
- **Virtual Betting**
  - Introduce virtual currency or stakes for engaging in predictions.
  - Record and display individual bet histories.
- **Prediction History & Metrics**
  - Maintain historical records of predictions and their outcomes.
  - Compute user-specific metrics (e.g., prediction accuracy, ROI).

### Notifications
- **Real-Time Notifications**
  - Integrate socket-based or push notifications for prediction outcomes, comments, and likes.
- **Periodic Summaries**
  - Email or in-app summary notifications for daily/weekly activity.

---

## Phase 3: Community Building & Engagement (Month 5-6)
_Focus on promoting engagement and community-driven content._

### Leaderboards & Reputation
- **Leaderboard Implementation**
  - Create dynamic leaderboards based on prediction accuracy and activity.
  - Offer filtering options (e.g., weekly, monthly, all-time).
- **Reputation System**
  - Develop a points or ranking system that reflects user engagement and prediction success.

### Enhanced Social Interactions
- **Friend System & Connections**
  - Allow users to add friends or form groups.
  - Provide private messaging or group discussions.
- **Content Sharing**
  - Enable sharing of posts and predictions to external networks (e.g., via social media sharing buttons).
  - Implement “re-sharing” or “boosting” within the platform.

### Moderation & Reporting Tools
- **Content Moderation**
  - Implement user-based content reporting mechanisms.
  - Build a moderation dashboard for administrators.
- **Automated Spam/Abuse Filters**
  - Integrate tools to detect and flag potential spam or abusive behavior.

## Phase 4: Optimization, Scalability & Advanced Features (Month 7+)
_Aim to ensure stable performance, security, and prepare the platform for future expansion._

### Performance & Security Enhancements
- **Database Optimization**
  - Optimize queries and introduce indexing to support scaling.
  - Consider database sharding or replication if necessary.
- **Security**
  - Implement environment variable management for secrets (JWT, database credentials).
  - Enhance API security with rate limiting and advanced threat protection.
- **Infrastructure Improvements**
  - Container orchestration improvements (e.g., Kubernetes) for scalability.

### UX/UI Enhancements
- **Responsive & Accessible Design**
  - Optimize UI layouts for mobile, tablet, and desktop experiences.
  - Ensure all components meet WCAG accessibility guidelines.
- **UI Refinements**
  - Incorporate design feedback to improve visual aesthetics and usability.

### Advanced Analytics & Insights
- **User Analytics**
  - Develop a dashboard for users to see performance analytics on their predictions.
- **System Monitoring**
  - Build admin dashboards with real-time system performance metrics and error reporting.

---

## Additional Considerations
- **Testing & Continuous Integration**
  - Introduce automated unit tests, integration tests, and end-to-end tests.
  - Integrate CI/CD pipelines for efficient deployment.
- **Documentation**
  - Maintain comprehensive documentation (API docs, user guides, internal development guidelines).
- **User Feedback**
  - Regularly collect and analyze user feedback to guide feature improvements.
- **Iterative Updates**
  - Use agile methodologies to release features in sprints and iteratively refine them.
